This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the Timeline application (the "App").

1. Information We Collect
We want to be clear and transparent: The Timeline app does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information from its users.

The application is designed to work completely offline. All historical data displayed within the app is included in the application package and is not retrieved from a remote server. We do not use any analytics, trackers, or advertising services.

2. How We Use Your Information
Since we do not collect any information, your data is not used for any purpose. All functionalities, such as searching for events or filtering by country and year, are processed locally on your device.

3. Information Sharing and Disclosure
We do not have any of your personal information to share. The app does not share any data with the developer or any third parties.

The app includes a "Share" feature that allows you to voluntarily share the text of a historical event using the native sharing capabilities of your Android device. This action is initiated by you, and we do not track what you share or with whom you share it.

4. Permissions
The Timeline app does not request any special permissions. It does not need access to your contacts, location, camera, storage, or any other sensitive information on your device.

5. Children's Privacy
The application does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since the app does not collect any data at all, it is safe for use by people of all ages.
