PRIVACY POLICY  
Last updated: 22 July 2025

Melle Apps (“we”, “our”, “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy.  
This document explains how information is handled when you use ClipBoard Easy (the “App”).  
By installing or using the App you agree to the terms below. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
• We do not collect, store, or share any personally‑identifiable information (PII).  
• All clipboard data, notes, and any files you open stay on your device; their contents are never uploaded.  
• Crash logs and analytics are disabled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PERMISSIONS AND PURPOSE

INTERNET  
  – Loads Google AdMob ads.  
  – Opens outbound affiliate links in your browser when tapped.  
  – No clipboard or personal data leaves your device.

READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE  
  – Lets you browse, import, back‑up, and restore local text/PDF files.  
  – Nothing is copied off‑device.  
  – Requested in “legacy” mode only to remain compatible with Android 6–10 devices.

The App never accesses the system clipboard in the background; it reacts only when you actively paste or save a note.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. THIRD‑PARTY SDKS

Google AdMob  
  • Displays banner and interstitial ads that keep the App free.  
  • May use the device’s advertising ID for ad personalisation (subject to your consent).  
  • Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

User Messaging Platform (UMP)  
  • Shows the GDPR/CCPA consent form required by AdMob.  
  • Stores your ad‑consent choice in local shared preferences.  
  • Docs: https://developers.google.com/admob/ump/android/quick-start

Firebase Realtime Database (offline‑only mode)  
  • Stores non‑personal app settings locally; cloud sync is disabled.  
  • Policy: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy

We do not control any data collected by these providers.  
Please refer to their respective privacy policies for details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. AFFILIATE LINKS

The App may display optional affiliate links (managed via a small Firebase configuration).  
• Links are not always active — they appear only during campaign periods.  
• If you tap one, you leave the App and the retailer (e.g., Amazon) may place its own cookies or tracking tags under its own privacy policy.  
• We receive a commission on qualifying purchases; no personal data about you is shared with us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

The App is not directed to children under 13.  
We do not knowingly collect data from children.  
If a parent or guardian believes that a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. DATA SECURITY

All data processed by the App remains on your device.  
While we use commercially acceptable safeguards, no method of electronic storage is 100 % secure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
Changes are effective immediately upon posting in this document.  
Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
