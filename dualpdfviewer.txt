Privacy Policy
Last updated: 03 June 2025

Melle Apps (“we”, “our”, “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This document explains how information is handled when you use DualPDF (the “App”). By installing or using the App you agree to the terms below. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

Information We Collect

• We do not collect, store, or share any personally-identifiable information (PII).
• All PDF files you open stay local on your device; their contents are never uploaded.

Permissions and Purpose

• INTERNET – required to load Google AdMob ads and, when tapped, open Amazon affiliate links in your browser.
• READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE – allow you to browse, open, and locally cache PDF documents. No file is copied off your device.
(The App requests legacy external-storage access only to maintain compatibility with Android 6–10 devices.)

Third-Party Services

The App integrates the following SDKs, which may collect device or advertising identifiers under their own privacy policies:

• Google AdMob – displays banner and interstitial ads that keep the App free.
Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

• Firebase Realtime Database (offline-only mode) – stores non-personal app settings locally; cloud sync is disabled.
Policy: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy

• Amazon Affiliate Links – optional outbound links to Amazon product pages. If you tap one, Amazon applies its own cookies and tracking.
Policy: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496

We do not control data collected by these providers. Refer to their policies for details.

Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If a parent or guardian believes that a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.

Data Security

All data processed by the App remains on your device. While we use commercially acceptable safeguards, no method of electronic storage is 100 % secure.

Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes are effective immediately upon posting in this document. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
