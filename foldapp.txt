ABOUT THE APP
• FoldMeter is a minimal fold counter for foldable phones.
• It detects only two states using the hinge-angle sensor: Open and Closed.
• It increments the counter on full open↔close (or close↔open) transitions.

SUMMARY (TL;DR)
• We do not collect personal information from you.
• Fold counts and settings are stored locally on your device (Room database).
• Ads are served via Google Mobile Ads (AdMob); consent in EEA/UK is managed with the User Messaging Platform (UMP).

DATA WE PROCESS
• On-device (by the app): fold counts (today/total), Open/Closed transitions, basic settings (monitoring on/off, notifications). Stored locally; not sent to our servers.
• Advertising & consent (by third-party SDKs): AdMob may process device/ads identifiers (including AD_ID), IP-derived approximate location, ad interactions, and diagnostics for delivery, measurement, and fraud prevention. UMP stores your consent choices where required.
• We do not collect names, emails, contacts, messages, photos, precise location, or other sensitive categories.

PERMISSIONS & WHY
• FOREGROUND_SERVICE / FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC — run a reliable foreground service for counting.
• POST_NOTIFICATIONS (Android 13+) — show the persistent counting/status notification.
• WAKE_LOCK (optional) — prevent brief sleep during critical transitions on some devices.
• INTERNET — load ads and read remote configuration/content.
• com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID — allow AdMob to use the advertising ID where available.

ADS, CONSENT, AND YOUR CHOICES
• Consent (EEA/UK): managed via UMP; you can revisit your choices in-app (Settings) or by clearing app data.
• Personalized vs non-personalized ads: served according to your consent and OS settings.
• OS-level controls: reset/limit the Advertising ID and disable ad personalization in system settings.
• Children: the app is not intended for users under 13.

DATA SECURITY
• We minimize processing and keep counts on device.
• No method is 100% secure, but we apply reasonable technical and organizational measures.

RETENTION & DELETION
• On-device counts and settings remain until you delete them.
• You can delete data via: Reset Today (daily only), clearing app data, or uninstalling the app.
• Consent/ad data retention is handled by the respective providers.

THIRD-PARTY SDKS WE USE (PURPOSE ONLY)
• Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) — ads delivery/measurement/fraud prevention
• User Messaging Platform (UMP) — consent collection and storage
• Firebase Realtime Database — read-only remote configuration/content
• AndroidX Room — local database
• MPAndroidChart — simple in-app visuals
• AndroidX Lifecycle, Coroutines, Material, AppCompat, ConstraintLayout — app components

INTERNATIONAL PROCESSING
• Third-party partners may process data on servers outside your country, with appropriate safeguards where required.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
• We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
• We may update this policy from time to time; the “Last updated” date reflects the latest version.
